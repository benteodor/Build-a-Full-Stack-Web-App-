 ## Description 
 I took this Udemy course, where I practiced and learned more complex HTML and CSS. I emphasized key HTML concepts such as classes and ids, divs, spans, lists, and many others. I delved deeply into new CSS concepts, which 
 assisted me in styling a visually appealing page. I also started learning Javascript and adding functionality to the page.
